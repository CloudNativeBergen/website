# Event-Driven Integration Architecture

This document describes the event-driven architecture pattern used for handling business logic changes and their integrations throughout the system.

## Overview

The system uses an event-driven pattern to decouple business logic changes from their side effects (email notifications, external API calls, data synchronization, etc.). This provides better scalability, maintainability, and parallel processing capabilities.

## Architecture Components

### Event Bus

- Central message broker for publishing and subscribing to events
- Executes handlers in parallel for maximum performance
- Provides error isolation - one failing handler doesn't affect others
- Type-safe event definitions ensure reliability

### Event Types

- Strongly typed event definitions using TypeScript interfaces
- Events contain all context needed by handlers
- Consistent event structure across the application

### Event Handlers

- Individual handlers for each integration or side effect
- Self-contained and independently testable
- Can be enabled/disabled by simply registering/unregistering
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous operations

### Registry

- Centralized handler registration system
- Auto-discovery and registration of handlers
- Provides lifecycle management for event subscriptions

## Integration Examples

Common integration patterns include:

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Send automated emails based on business events
   - Support for templating and personalization

2. **External API Notifications**
   - Push updates to third-party services
   - Handle webhook notifications and callbacks

3. **Data Synchronization**
   - Update external systems when data changes
   - Maintain consistency across multiple platforms

4. **Audit Logging**
   - Record business events for compliance and debugging
   - Track user actions and system changes

## Adding New Integrations

To add a new integration:

1. Define your event handler function:

```typescript
export async function handleMyIntegration(event: BusinessEvent): Promise<void> {
  // Your integration logic here
  console.log('Processing event:', event.type)

  // Perform your side effects
  await performIntegrationTask(event.data)
}
```

1. Register the handler:

```typescript
eventBus.subscribe('business.event.type', handleMyIntegration)
```

1. Publish events from your business logic:

```typescript
await eventBus.publish('business.event.type', {
  type: 'business.event.type',
  data: eventData,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  correlationId: generateId(),
})
```

## Benefits

### ✅ **Parallel Processing**

All integrations run simultaneously, not sequentially

### ✅ **Error Isolation**

One failing integration doesn't break others

### ✅ **Non-blocking**

The main business logic completes immediately, integrations run asynchronously

### ✅ **Easy Testing**

Each handler can be tested in isolation

### ✅ **Scalability**

Easy to add/remove integrations without touching core business logic

### ✅ **Maintainability**

Clear separation of concerns between business logic and side effects

### ✅ **Observability**

Easy to monitor and debug event flows

## Performance Characteristics

- **Parallel Execution**: All integrations run simultaneously
- **Fast Response Times**: Core business logic is not blocked by integrations
- **Error Resilience**: Failed integrations don't impact user experience
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal use of system resources through parallel processing

## Event Design Guidelines

### Event Structure

Events should follow a consistent structure:

```typescript
interface BaseEvent {
  type: string
  data: Record<string, any>
  timestamp: Date
  correlationId: string
  userId?: string
}
```

### Event Naming

Use descriptive, hierarchical event names:

- `user.created`
- `order.status.changed`
- `payment.processed`
- `notification.sent`

### Event Data

Include all necessary context in event data:

- Primary entity information
- Previous state (for change events)
- User context
- Metadata for processing

## Error Handling

### Handler Errors

- Individual handler failures are isolated
- Errors are logged with context
- Failed events can be retried or sent to dead letter queues
- System continues operating normally

### Event Publishing

- Validate events before publishing
- Handle serialization errors gracefully
- Provide fallback mechanisms for critical events

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for scalable event-driven systems:

1. **Distributed Event Bus**: Replace in-memory event bus with Redis/AWS EventBridge for microservices
2. **Event Persistence**: Add event store for replay and audit capabilities
3. **Dead Letter Queues**: Handle failed events with retry mechanisms
4. **Event Versioning**: Support backward compatibility for event schema changes
5. **Metrics and Monitoring**: Add comprehensive observability for event processing
6. **Event Sourcing**: Consider event sourcing for complex domain models
7. **Circuit Breakers**: Add resilience patterns for external integrations
