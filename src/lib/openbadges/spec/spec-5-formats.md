5. Open Badges Document Formats

OpenBadgeCredentials can be exchanged as documents as defined in this section, or by using the Open Badges API. Documents can be exchanged as a text file, a web resource, or embedded in an image. The contents of an Open Badge document MUST meet the following criteria:

    The contents of the file MUST represent exactly one OpenBadgeCredential
    The OpenBadgeCredential MUST be serialized as JSON and JSON-LD (see § A. Serialization)
    JSON exchanged between systems that are not part of a closed ecosystem MUST be encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629].

Example 1: Sample OpenBadgeCredential file contents

    Verifiable Credential (with proof)
    Verifiable Credential (as JWT)

}]
}

5.1 File Format

If the credential is signed using the § 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format (VC-JWT) the contents of the file MUST be the Compact JWS string formed as a result of signing the OpenBadgeCredential with VC-JWT. The file extension SHOULD be ".jws" or ".jwt".

If an embedded proof method is used instead, the contents of the file MUST be the JSON representation of the OpenBadgeCredential. The file extension SHOULD be ".json".
5.2 Web Resource

If the credential is signed using the § 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format (VC-JWT) the contents of the response MUST be the Compact JWS string formed as a result of signing the OpenBadgeCredential with VC-JWT. The Content-Type SHOULD be text/plain.

If an embedded proof method is used instead, the contents of the response MUST be the JSON representation of the OpenBadgeCredential. The Content-Type SHOULD be application/vc+ld+json, although generic representations such application/ld+json or application/json are also allowed.
5.3 Baked Badge

OpenBadgeCredentials may be exchanged as image files with the credential encoded (baked) within. This allows the credential to be portable wherever image files may be stored or displayed.

"Baking" is the process of taking an OpenBadgeCredential and embedding it into the image, so that when a user displays the image on a page, software that is Open Badges aware can automatically extract that OpenBadgeCredential data and perform the checks necessary to see if a person legitimately earned the achievement within the image. The image MUST be in either PNG [PNG] or SVG [SVG11] format in order to support baking.
5.3.1 PNG
5.3.1.1 Baking

An iTXt chunk should be inserted into the PNG with keyword openbadgecredential.

If the credential is signed using the § 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format (VC-JWT) the text value of the chunk MUST be the Compact JWS string formed as a result of signing the OpenBadgeCredential with VC-JWT. Compression MUST NOT be used.
Example 2: An example of creating a chunk with VC-JWT proof (assuming an iTXt constructor)

var chunk = new iTXt({
keyword: 'openbadgecredential',
compression: 0,
compressionMethod: 0,
languageTag: '',
translatedKeyword: '',
text: 'header.payload.signature'
})

If an embedded proof method is used instead, the text value of the chunk MUST be the JSON representation of the OpenBadgeCredential. Compression MUST NOT be used.
Example 3: An example of creating a chunk with embedded proof (assuming an iTXt constructor)

var chunk = new iTXt({
keyword: 'openbadgecredential',
compression: 0,
compressionMethod: 0,
languageTag: '',
translatedKeyword: '',
text: '{
"@context": [
"https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2",
"https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/ob/v3p0/context-3.0.3.json"
],
"id": "http://example.edu/credentials/3732",
"type": ["VerifiableCredential", "OpenBadgeCredential"],
"issuer": {
"id": "https://example.edu/issuers/565049",
"type": "Profile",
"name": "Example University"
},
"validFrom": "2010-01-01T00:00:00Z",
"credentialSubject": {
"id": "did:example:ebfeb1f712ebc6f1c276e12ec21"
},
"proof": { }
}'
})

An iTXt chunk with the keyword openbadgecredential MUST NOT appear in a PNG more than once. When baking an image that already contains credential data, the implementer may choose whether to pass the user an error or overwrite the existing chunk.
5.3.1.2 Extracting

Parse the PNG datastream until the first iTXt chunk is found with the keyword openbadgecredential. The rest of the stream can be safely discarded. The text portion of the iTXt will either be the JSON representation of a § B.1.2 AchievementCredential or the Compact JWS string that was the result of signing the OpenBadgeCredential with § 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format.
5.3.2 SVG
5.3.2.1 Baking

First, add an xmlns:openbadges attribute to the <svg> tag with the value "https://purl.imsglobal.org/ob/v3p0". Directly after the <svg> tag, add an <openbadges:credential> tag.

If the credential is signed using the § 8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format (VC-JWT) add a verify attribute to the <openbadges:credential> tag. The value of verify attribute MUST be the Compact JWS string formed as a result of signing the OpenBadgeCredential with VC-JWT.
Example 4: An example of a well baked SVG with VC-JWT proof

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:openbadges="https://purl.imsglobal.org/ob/v3p0"
  viewBox="0 0 512 512">
<openbadges:credential verify="header.payload.signature"></openbadges:credential>

  <!-- rest-of-image -->
</svg>

If an embedded proof method is used instead, omit the verify attribute, and the JSON representation of the OpenBadgeCredential MUST go into the body of the tag, wrapped in <![CDATA[...]]>.
Example 5: An example of a well baked SVG with embedded proof

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:openbadges="https://purl.imsglobal.org/ob/v3p0"

<openbadges:credential>

<![CDATA[

        },
        "proof": { }
      }
    ]]>

</openbadges:credential>

  <!-- rest-of-image -->
</svg>

There MUST be only one <openbadges:credential> tag in an SVG. When baking an image that already contains OpenBadgeCredential data, the implementer may choose whether to pass the user an error or overwrite the existing tag.
5.3.2.2 Extracting

Parse the SVG until you reach the first <openbadges:credential> tag. The rest of the SVG data can safely be discarded.
