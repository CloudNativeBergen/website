8. Proofs (Signatures)

This section describes mechanisms for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of OpenBadgeCredentials. At least one proof mechanism, and the details necessary to evaluate that proof, MUST be expressed for a credential to be a verifiable credential; that is, to be verifiable. In order to pass 1EdTech conformance tests, issuers MUST use a proof mechanism supported by the 1EdTech conformance test suite. See more about Selecting proof methods and crypto algorithms in the Implementation Guide.
8.1 Proof Formats

The proof formats included in this specification fall into two categories:

    JSON Web Token Proof - Sometimes called VC-JWT, this format has a single implementation: the credential is encoded into a JWT which is then signed and encoded as a JWS. The JSON Web Token proof is called an external proof because the proof wraps the credential object.
    Linked Data Proofs - The credential is signed and the signature is used to form a Proof object which is appended to the credential. This format supports many different proof types. These are called embedded proofs because the proof is embedded in the data.

Note
The issuer MAY use multiple proofs. If multiple proofs are provided, the verifier MAY use any one proof to verify the credential.

A third category of proof format called Non-Signature Proof is not covered by this specification. This category includes proofs such as proof of work.
8.2 JSON Web Token Proof Format

This proof format relies on the well established JWT (JSON Web Token) [RFC7519] and JWS (JSON Web Signature) [RFC7515] specifications. A JSON Web Token Proof is a JWT signed and encoded as a Compact JWS string. The proof format is described in detail in [VC-JOSE-COSE], referred from Section 5.13 "Securing Mechanism Specifications" of Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0. That description allows several options which may inhibit interoperability. This specification limits the options while maintaining compatibility with [VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0] to help ensure interoperability.
Note
At the time of the completion of this specification, the JSON Web Token Proof Format of [VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0] was undergoing a revision process. [VC-JOSE-COSE] will collect and display the result of this revision. The modifications resulting from the incompatibility of the revision with what is contained in this document will be added in future revisions.
8.2.1 Terminology

Some of the terms used in this section include:

    JWT - "JSON Web Token (JWT) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS) structure or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure, enabling the claims to be digitally signed or integrity protected with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted." [RFC7519]
    JWS - "JSON Web Signature (JWS) represents content secured with digital signatures or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) using JSON-based data structures. Cryptographic algorithms and identifiers for use with this specification are described in the separate JSON Web Algorithms (JWA) specification and an IANA registry defined by that specification." [RFC7515]
    JWK - "A JSON Web Key (JWK) is a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) data structure that represents a cryptographic key." [RFC7517]
    Compact JWS - "A compact representation of a JWS." [RFC7515]

8.2.2 Overview

A JWS is a signed JWT with three parts separated by period (".") characters. Each part contains a base64url-encoded value.

    JOSE Header - Describes the cryptographic operations applied to the JWT and optionally, additional properties of the JWT. [RFC7515]
    JWT Payload - The JSON object that will be signed. In this specification, the JWT Payload includes the OpenBadgeCredential.
    JWS Signature - The computed signature of the JWT Payload.

The JOSE Header, JWT Payload, and JWS Signature are combined to form a Compact JWS. To transform a credential into a Compact JWS takes 4 steps:

    Create the JOSE Header, specifying the signing algorithm to use
    Create the JWT Payload from the credential to be signed
    Compute the signature of the JWT Payload
    Encode the resulting JWS as a Compact JWS

The resulting JWS proves that the issuer signed the JWT Payload turning the credential into a verifiable credential.

When using the JSON Web Token Proof Format, the proof property MAY be omitted from the OpenBadgeCredential. If a Linked Data Proof is also provided, it MUST be created before the JSON Web Token Proof Format is created.
8.2.3 Create the JOSE Header

The JOSE Header is a JSON object with the following properties (also called JOSE Headers). Additional JOSE Headers are NOT allowed.
Property / JOSE Header Type Description Required?
alg String The signing algorithm MUST be "RS256" as a minimum as defined in [RFC7518]. Support for other algorithms is permitted but their use limits interoperability. Later versions of this specification MAY add OPTIONAL support for other algorithms. See Section 6.1 RSA Key of the IMS Global Security Framework v1.1. Required
kid URI A URI that can be dereferenced to an object of type JWK representing the public key used to verify the signature. If you do not include a kid property in the header, you MUST include the public key in the jwk property.
Be careful not to accidentally expose the JWK representation of a private key. See RFC7517 for examples of private key representations. The JWK MUST never contain "d".
Optional
jwk JWK A JWK representing the public key used to verify the signature. If you do not include a jwk property in the header, you MUST include the kid property.
Be careful not to accidentally expose the JWK representation of a private key. See RFC7517 for examples of private key representations. The JWK MUST never contain "d".
Optional
typ String If present, MUST be set to "JWT". Optional
Example 29: Sample JOSE Header with reference to a public key in a JWKS

{
"alg": "RS256",
"kid": "https://example.edu/keys#key-1",
"typ": "JWT"
}

8.2.4 Create the JWT Payload

If you are going to use both external and embedded proof formats, add the embedded proofs prior to creating the JWT Payload.
8.2.4.1 JWT Payload Format

The JWT Payload is the JSON object of the OpenBadgeCredential with the following properties (JWT Claims). Additional standard JWT Claims Names are allowed, but their relationship to the credential is not defined.
Property / Claim Name Type Description Required?
exp NumericDate The validUntil property of the OpenBadgeCredential. Required if the OpenBadgeCredential has an validUntil. Optional
iss URI The issuer.id property of the OpenBadgeCredential. Required
jti URI The id property of the OpenBadgeCredential. Required
nbf NumericDate The validFrom property of the OpenBadgeCredential. Required
sub URI The credentialSubject.id property of the OpenBadgeCredential. Required
8.2.5 Create the Proof
Note: Sign and Encode the JWS

1EdTech strongly recommends using an existing, stable library for this step.

This section uses the follow notations:

    JOSE Header - denotes the JSON string representation of the JOSE Header.
    JWT Payload - denotes the JSON string representation of the JWT Payload.
    BASE64URL(OCTETS) - denotes the base64url encoding of OCTETS per [RFC7515].
    UTF8(STRING) - denotes the octets of the UTF-8 [RFC3629] representation of STRING, where STRING is a sequence of Unicode [UNICODE] characters.
    The concatenation of two values A and B is denoted as A || B.

The steps to sign and encode the credential as a Compact JWS are shown below:

    Encode the JOSE Header as BASE64URL(UTF8(JOSE Header)).
    Encode the JWT Payload as BASE64URL(JWT Payload).
    Concatenate the encoded JOSE Header and the encoded JSW Payload as A | "." | B.
    Calculate the JWS Signature for C as described in [RFC7515].
    Encode the signature as BASE64URL(JWS Signature).
    Concatenate C and E as C | "." | E.

The resulting string is the Compact JWS representation of the credential. The Compact JWS includes the credential AND acts as the proof for the credential.
8.2.6 Verify a Credential

Verifiers that receive a OpenBadgeCredential in Compact JWS format MUST perform the following steps to verify the embedded credential.

    Base64url-decode the JOSE Header.

    If the header includes a kid property, Dereference the kid value to retrieve the public key JWK.

    If the header includes a jwk property, convert the jwk value into the public key JWK.

    Use the public key JWK to verify the signature as described in "Section 5.2 Message Signature or MAC Validation" of [RFC7515]. If the signature is not valid, the credential proof is not valid.
    Note: Verifying the JWS Signature

    1EdTech strongly recommends using an existing, stable library for this step.

    Base64url-decode the JWT Payload segment of the Compact JWS and parse it into a JSON object.

    Convert the value of the JWT Payload to an OpenBadgeCredential and continue with § 8.2.6.1 Verify a Credential VC-JWT Signature.
    Note
    Credentials created following Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0 ([VC-DATA-MODEL]) store the OpenBadgeCredential in the vc claim of the JWT Payload. In this case, the contents of the vc claim must be converted to an OpenBadgeCredential and continue with § 8.2.6.1 Verify a Credential VC-JWT Signature.

8.2.6.1 Verify a Credential VC-JWT Signature

    The JSON object MUST have the iss claim, and the value MUST match the issuer.id of the OpenBadgeCredential object. If they do not match, the credential is not valid.
    The JSON object MUST have the sub claim, and the value MUST match the credentialSubject.id of the OpenBadgeCredential object. If they do not match, the credential is not valid.
    The JSON object MUST have the nbf claim, and the NumericDate value MUST be converted to a DateTime, and MUST equal the validFrom of the OpenBadgeCredential object. If they do not match or if the validFrom has not yet occurred, the credential is not valid.
    The JSON object MUST have the jti claim, and the value MUST match the id of the OpenBadgeCredential object. If they do not match, the credential is not valid.
    If the JSON object has the exp claim, the NumericDate MUST be converted to a DateTime, and MUST be used to set the value of the validUntil of the OpenBadgeCredential object. If the credential has expired, the credential is not valid.

Note
Credentials created following Verifiable Credentials Data Model v2.0 ([VC-DATA-MODEL]) have different names for attributes used in this process. Concretely, they have issuanceDate and expirationDate instead of validFrom and validUntil, respectively
8.3 Linked Data Proof Format

This standard supports the Linked Data Proof format. In order to pass conformance tests for this format issuers MUST use an option supported by the 1EdTech conformance test suite, which is currently limited to the Data Integrity EdDSA Cryptosuites v1.0 suite.
Note
Whenever possible, you should use a library or service to create and verify a Linked Data Proof.
8.3.1 Create the Proof

Attach a Linked Data Proof to the credential, for example by following these steps to use a proof with the [VC-DI-EDDSA] suite:

    Create an instance of Multikey as shown in Section 2.1.1 DataIntegrityProof of [VC-DI-EDDSA].
    Using the key material, sign the credential object as shown in Section 7.1 Proof Algorithm of [DATA-INTEGRITY-SPEC] to produce a Proof as shown in Section 2.2.1 DataIntegrityProof of [VC-DI-EDDSA] with a proofPurpose of "assertionMethod".
    Add the resulting proof object to the credential proof property.

8.3.2 Verify an OpenBadgeCredential Linked Data Signature

Verify the Linked Data Proof signature as shown in Section 7.2 Proof Verification Algorithm of [DATA-INTEGRITY-SPEC].
8.4 Key Management

Issuers will need to manage asymmetric keys. The mechanisms by which keys are minted and distributed is outside the scope of this specification. See Section 6. Key Management of the IMS Global Security Framework v1.1.
8.5 Dereferencing the Public Key

All the proof formats in this specification, and all Digital Integrity proofs in general, require the verifier to "dereference" the public key from a URI. Dereferencing means using the URI to get the public key in JWK format. This specification allows the use of an HTTP URL (e.g. https://1edtech.org/keys/1) or a DID URL (e.g. did:key:123), but only requires HTTP URL support.
